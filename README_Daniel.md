1.I created 2 Web API end points in Visual studio. One is a [HttpGet] method to get people data into a table(in #view1) and 
the other is [HttpPut] to update people attributes in Edit Person form in (#view2).
2. [HttpGet] method is working as expected, [HttpPut] method is working when you test it from postman 
but for some reasons when I bind it with Edit Person form I am facing an issue.
3.I used Twitter Bootstrap in both table and edit form to make them look presentable.
4.I also did the same application using ASP.NET MVC. If you run Web API sln in the browser if you go to Home tab
you will see people table and names are clickable and that will take to edit person form which is functioning as expected.
I used bootsotrap in MVC application as well.
